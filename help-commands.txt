Hello! I am Daisy :)

I am always listening to you... hehe

Here's how I can help you:

1) **Reminders**: Set a reminder with either
- `*task {hours}h{minutes}min {task description}`, or
- `*task {minutes} {task description}`.
I will check up on you in that many minutes.

If you finish the task, react to your message with :white_check_mark: I will say good job because I am proud!

If you can't finish it, or don't want me to say good job... ðŸ˜¢ just react with :negative_squared_cross_mark:


2) **Jokes**: Ask me a knock knock joke with `*knock`. After I say "knock knock",
say `*who's there`?. Then when I tell you the <name>, respond with `*<name> who?`


3) **Clean**: Ah.... I tidy up my own mess too... Just ask me to `*clean` and I'll clean up to 30 of my messages up

4) **Talk**: Use `*talk` to talk to me. I'm still being trained to talk well, but I can have some small talk, and tell you jokes
